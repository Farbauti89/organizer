Welcome to our first Hackergarten in Berlin. 

If you don't know what a Hackergarten is, just bring your laptop and be there at 18:00. 
We will give a short introduction what Hackergarten is and show you how to contribute on github.
Some Hackergarten ideas can be found here https://github.com/hackergarten-berlin/organizer/blob/master/introduction.adoc and there http://hackergarten.net

Maybe you already know what a Hackergarten is, just bring your laptop and some good ideas and be there at 19:00.
For us good ideas are issues which can be solved in three hours, allow people to contribute although they are no experts and can be explained in two minutes.

We prepared the following agenda. 

19:15 pitching ideas and building groups (

19:30 start hacking

21:30 eating pizza and socialising

22:00 demo of achievements (if wanted)

22:30 going home

We are happy to see you soon. :-)
